!Series_summary	"Hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1 (HSN1) is caused by mutations in either the SPTLC1 or SPTLC2 sub-units of the enzyme Serine Palmitoyl Transferase resulting in the production of Deoxyshingobases (DSBs). Exogenous DSBs are toxic when acutely applied to neurons however it’s unknown whether endogenous DSBs are neurotoxic and the mechanism of such toxicity. Using induced pleuripotent stem cells (iPSC) from HSN1 patients we found increased DSB production from both hepatocytes and sensory neurons. Gene expression profiling in HSN1 iPSCd-sensory neurons showed dysregulation in axon outgrowth and lipid signalling pathways. We noted reduced lipid raft formation, impaired growth factor signalling and reduced neurite outgrowth in these neurons. Gangliosides which are essential for membrane dynamics and lipid raft formation and were globally reduced due to feedback inhibition of DSBs on the enzyme… In co-cultures between HSN1 iPSCd-sensory neurons and rat Schwann the nodal complex and myelin were disrupted.  HSN1 SPTLC mutations therefor impair cell autonomous and inter-cellular signalling due to altered lipid metabolism, changes which could largely be prevented by treatment with Serine (which reduces DSB production) supporting Serine as a rational therapy."

!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1	"Induced pluripotent stem cell generation  NHDF1 (from 44-year-old female) was reprogrammed with Yamanaka retroviruses SOX2, KLF4, OCT3/4, c-MYC and NANOG (Takahashi et al., 2006), and has previously been described (Hartfield et al., 2014). AD2-01 (from 51-year-old male) (Buskin et al., in preparation) and AD3-01 (from 37-year-old female) (Baud et al, 2017) were reprogrammed using the CytoTune™-iPS Reprogramming Kit (ThermoFisher). The fibroblasts to generate AD2-01 and AD3-01 were obtained from a commercial source (Lonza, CC-2511, LOT 264781).   CytoTune-iPS reprogramming was performed as directed by the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher). The CytoTune reprogramming kit contains four Sendai virus-based reprogramming vectors each capable of expressing one of the four Yamanaka factors (KLF4, OCT3/4, SOX2 and c-MYC). Briefly, after fibroblast transduction with the four Sendai virus-based reprogramming vectors, cells are cultured for 5-6 days, with medium changes every other day (DMEM, high glucose (Sigma), 10% FBS (ThermoFisher), 1% Pen/Strep (100x, ThermoFisher), 200mM L-glutamine (Sigma), 1% non-essential amino acids (ThermoFisher)). The transduced fibroblasts are then passaged using 0.05% Trpsin-EDTA onto pre-prepared feeder layer plates containing mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). 3-4 weeks after transduction, colonies should have grown to an appropriate size to allow for manual picking. Using an inverted microscope, a single colony displaying iPSC morphology is cut into 5-6 pieces using a 25 gauge needle, transferred into iPS media (KO-DMEM (ThermoFisher), 25% Knock Serum Replacement (ThermoFisher), 1% nonessential amino acids (100x, ThermoFisher), 200mM L- glutamine (Sigma), 1% Pen/Strep (100x, ThermoFisher), 8 ng/ml human FGF2 (Miltenyi Biotec)) and plated onto pre-prepared MEF plates. Colonies are allowed to attach for 48 hours, and thereafter medium changes are performed daily. iPSCs were adapted to feeder-free conditions onto Matrigel (Scientific Laboratory Supplies)-coated plates in mTeSR1 medium (ScienCell). Bulk passaging was by 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to make large-scale, quality-controlled stocks that were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. The number of feeder-free passages was kept to a minimum. When selecting iPSCs from frozen stocks for differentiation, vials with the same passage number were selected for each cell line throughout all experiments performed in this study.  The iPSC lines AD2-01 and AD3-01 were obtained through the IMI/EU sponsored StemBANCC consortium via the Human Biomaterials Resource Centre, University of Birmingham, UK (http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/facilities/hbrc).  All iPSC lines were subject to strict quality control checks before the initiation of differentiation. Quality control checks of these lines included: tests for Sendai virus clearance, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for pluripotency markers, genomic integrity checks and embryoid body tri-lineage differentiation experiments. Cells are also confirmed as negative for Mycoplasma before cryopreservation.  Sensory neuron differentiation  For neuronal differentiation, iPSCs were passaged onto Matrigel®-coated six-well plates using TrypLE express (ThermoFisher Scientific) and maintained in mTeSR1 supplemented with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (ScienCell). Twenty-four hours after plating, the medium was exchanged to mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) conditioned medium (ScienCell) supplemented with 10 ng/ml human recombinant FGF2. Cells were allowed to expand on MEF-conditioned medium until ∼50% confluent, at which time differentiation was started according to Chambers et al. (2012). Briefly, medium was exchanged to knockout serum replacement (KSR) medium containing; knockout-DMEM, 15% knockout-serum replacement, 1% GlutaMAX™, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 μM β-mercaptoethanol, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (ThermoFisher Scientific), supplemented with the SMAD inhibitors SB431542 (Sigma, 10 μM) and LDN-193189 (Stratech, 100 nM). The medium was gradually transitioned from KSR medium to N2 medium (Neurobasal® medium, 2% B27 supplement, 1% N2 supplement, 1% GlutaMAX™, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic) (ThermoFisher Scientific) over an 11-day period. On Day 2, the small molecules CHIR99021 (Apollo Scientific, 3 μM), SU5402 (R&D Systems, 10 μM) and DAPT (Sigma, 10 μM) were also added. SMAD inhibitors were removed from the media from Day 6 onwards. On Day 11, the now immature neurons were replated onto Matrigel®-coated coverslips (25 000 cells per 13 mm coverslip) in 100% N2 medium containing human recombinant NGF, GDNF, BDNF, NT3 (all at 25 ng/ml, PeproTech) and 10 μM ROCK inhibitor. CHIR99021 (3 μM) was included in the medium until Day 14, and laminin (1 μg/ml, ThermoFisher Scientific) was supplemented into the medium from Day 20 onwards. Medium changes were performed twice weekly after replating. Cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside (AraC, 2 μM, Sigma) was included in the medium for 24 h following replating to remove the few non-neuronal dividing cells remaining in the culture. This differentiation resulted in a completely pure neuronal culture with extensive arborized neurites by 3 weeks after the end of the small inhibitor stage.  Ethics statement   Human iPSC lines used in this study were derived from human skin biopsy fibroblasts, following signed informed consent. Three control cells lines were used in this study – AD2-01, AD4-01 and NHDF1. NHDF1 were reprogrammed with approval from research ethics committee: National Health Service, Health Research Authority, NRES Committee South Central, Berkshire, UK (REC 10/H0505/71)."	"Induced pluripotent stem cell generation  NHDF1 (from 44-year-old female) was reprogrammed with Yamanaka retroviruses SOX2, KLF4, OCT3/4, c-MYC and NANOG (Takahashi et al., 2006), and has previously been described (Hartfield et al., 2014). AD2-01 (from 51-year-old male) (Buskin et al., in preparation) and AD3-01 (from 37-year-old female) (Baud et al, 2017) were reprogrammed using the CytoTune™-iPS Reprogramming Kit (ThermoFisher). The fibroblasts to generate AD2-01 and AD3-01 were obtained from a commercial source (Lonza, CC-2511, LOT 264781).   CytoTune-iPS reprogramming was performed as directed by the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher). The CytoTune reprogramming kit contains four Sendai virus-based reprogramming vectors each capable of expressing one of the four Yamanaka factors (KLF4, OCT3/4, SOX2 and c-MYC). Briefly, after fibroblast transduction with the four Sendai virus-based reprogramming vectors, cells are cultured for 5-6 days, with medium changes every other day (DMEM, high glucose (Sigma), 10% FBS (ThermoFisher), 1% Pen/Strep (100x, ThermoFisher), 200mM L-glutamine (Sigma), 1% non-essential amino acids (ThermoFisher)). The transduced fibroblasts are then passaged using 0.05% Trpsin-EDTA onto pre-prepared feeder layer plates containing mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). 3-4 weeks after transduction, colonies should have grown to an appropriate size to allow for manual picking. Using an inverted microscope, a single colony displaying iPSC morphology is cut into 5-6 pieces using a 25 gauge needle, transferred into iPS media (KO-DMEM (ThermoFisher), 25% Knock Serum Replacement (ThermoFisher), 1% nonessential amino acids (100x, ThermoFisher), 200mM L- glutamine (Sigma), 1% Pen/Strep (100x, ThermoFisher), 8 ng/ml human FGF2 (Miltenyi Biotec)) and plated onto pre-prepared MEF plates. Colonies are allowed to attach for 48 hours, and thereafter medium changes are performed daily. iPSCs were adapted to feeder-free conditions onto Matrigel (Scientific Laboratory Supplies)-coated plates in mTeSR1 medium (ScienCell). Bulk passaging was by 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to make large-scale, quality-controlled stocks that were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. The number of feeder-free passages was kept to a minimum. When selecting iPSCs from frozen stocks for differentiation, vials with the same passage number were selected for each cell line throughout all experiments performed in this study.  The iPSC lines AD2-01 and AD3-01 were obtained through the IMI/EU sponsored StemBANCC consortium via the Human Biomaterials Resource Centre, University of Birmingham, UK (http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/facilities/hbrc).  All iPSC lines were subject to strict quality control checks before the initiation of differentiation. Quality control checks of these lines included: tests for Sendai virus clearance, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for pluripotency markers, genomic integrity checks and embryoid body tri-lineage differentiation experiments. Cells are also confirmed as negative for Mycoplasma before cryopreservation.

The medium was gradually transitioned from KSR medium to N2 medium (Neurobasal® medium, 2% B27 supplement, 1% N2 supplement, 1% GlutaMAX™, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic) (ThermoFisher Scientific) over an 11-day period. On Day 2, the small molecules CHIR99021 (Apollo Scientific, 3 μM), SU5402 (R&D Systems, 10 μM) and DAPT (Sigma, 10 μM) were also added. SMAD inhibitors were removed from the media from Day 6 onwards. On Day 11, the now immature neurons were replated onto Matrigel®-coated coverslips (25 000 cells per 13 mm coverslip) in 100% N2 medium containing human recombinant NGF, GDNF, BDNF, NT3 (all at 25 ng/ml, PeproTech) and 10 μM ROCK inhibitor. CHIR99021 (3 μM) was included in the medium until Day 14, and laminin (1 μg/ml, ThermoFisher Scientific) was supplemented into the medium from Day 20 onwards. Medium changes were performed twice weekly after replating. Cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside (AraC, 2 μM, Sigma) was included in the medium for 24 h following replating to remove the few non-neuronal dividing cells remaining in the culture. This differentiation resulted in a completely pure neuronal culture with extensive arborized neurites by 3 weeks after the end of the small inhibitor stage.  Ethics statement   Human iPSC lines used in this study were derived from human skin biopsy fibroblasts, following signed informed consent. Three control cells lines were used in this study – AD2-01, AD4-01 and NHDF1. NHDF1 were reprogrammed with approval from research ethics committee: National Health Service, Health Research Authority, NRES Committee South Central, Berkshire, UK (REC 10/H0505/71)."	"Induced pluripotent stem cell generation  NHDF1 (from 44-year-old female) was reprogrammed with Yamanaka retroviruses SOX2, KLF4, OCT3/4, c-MYC and NANOG (Takahashi et al., 2006), and has previously been described (Hartfield et al., 2014). AD2-01 (from 51-year-old male) (Buskin et al., in preparation) and AD3-01 (from 37-year-old female) (Baud et al, 2017) were reprogrammed using the CytoTune™-iPS Reprogramming Kit (ThermoFisher). The fibroblasts to generate AD2-01 and AD3-01 were obtained from a commercial source (Lonza, CC-2511, LOT 264781).   CytoTune-iPS reprogramming was performed as directed by the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher). The CytoTune reprogramming kit contains four Sendai virus-based reprogramming vectors each capable of expressing one of the four Yamanaka factors (KLF4, OCT3/4, SOX2 and c-MYC). Briefly, after fibroblast transduction with the four Sendai virus-based reprogramming vectors, cells are cultured for 5-6 days, with medium changes every other day (DMEM, high glucose (Sigma), 10% FBS (ThermoFisher), 1% Pen/Strep (100x, ThermoFisher), 200mM L-glutamine (Sigma), 1% non-essential amino acids (ThermoFisher)). The transduced fibroblasts are then passaged using 0.05% Trpsin-EDTA onto pre-prepared feeder layer plates containing mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). 3-4 weeks after transduction, colonies should have grown to an appropriate size to allow for manual picking. Using an inverted microscope, a single colony displaying iPSC morphology is cut into 5-6 pieces using a 25 gauge needle, transferred into iPS media (KO-DMEM (ThermoFisher), 25% Knock Serum Replacement (ThermoFisher), 1% nonessential amino acids (100x, ThermoFisher), 200mM L- glutamine (Sigma), 1% Pen/Strep (100x, ThermoFisher), 8 ng/ml human FGF2 (Miltenyi Biotec)) and plated onto pre-prepared MEF plates. Colonies are allowed to attach for 48 hours, and thereafter medium changes are performed daily. iPSCs were adapted to feeder-free conditions onto Matrigel (Scientific Laboratory Supplies)-coated plates in mTeSR1 medium (ScienCell). Bulk passaging was by 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to make large-scale, quality-controlled stocks that were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. The number of feeder-free passages was kept to a minimum. When selecting iPSCs from frozen stocks for differentiation, vials with the same passage number were selected for each cell line throughout all experiments performed in this study.  The iPSC lines AD2-01 and AD3-01 were obtained through the IMI/EU sponsored StemBANCC consortium via the Human Biomaterials Resource Centre, University of Birmingham, UK (http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/facilities/hbrc).  All iPSC lines were subject to strict quality control checks before the initiation of differentiation. Quality control checks of these lines included: tests for Sendai virus clearance, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for pluripotency markers, genomic integrity checks and embryoid body tri-lineage differentiation experiments. Cells are also confirmed as negative for Mycoplasma before cryopreservation.  Sensory neuron differentiation  For neuronal differentiation, iPSCs were passaged onto Matrigel®-coated six-well plates using TrypLE express (ThermoFisher Scientific) and maintained in mTeSR1 supplemented with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (ScienCell).

On Day 2, the small molecules CHIR99021 (Apollo Scientific, 3 μM), SU5402 (R&D Systems, 10 μM) and DAPT (Sigma, 10 μM) were also added. SMAD inhibitors were removed from the media from Day 6 onwards. On Day 11, the now immature neurons were replated onto Matrigel®-coated coverslips (25 000 cells per 13 mm coverslip) in 100% N2 medium containing human recombinant NGF, GDNF, BDNF, NT3 (all at 25 ng/ml, PeproTech) and 10 μM ROCK inhibitor. CHIR99021 (3 μM) was included in the medium until Day 14, and laminin (1 μg/ml, ThermoFisher Scientific) was supplemented into the medium from Day 20 onwards. Medium changes were performed twice weekly after replating. Cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside (AraC, 2 μM, Sigma) was included in the medium for 24 h following replating to remove the few non-neuronal dividing cells remaining in the culture. This differentiation resulted in a completely pure neuronal culture with extensive arborized neurites by 3 weeks after the end of the small inhibitor stage.  Ethics statement   Human iPSC lines used in this study were derived from human skin biopsy fibroblasts, following signed informed consent. Three control cells lines were used in this study – AD2-01, AD4-01 and NHDF1. NHDF1 were reprogrammed with approval from research ethics committee: National Health Service, Health Research Authority, NRES Committee South Central, Berkshire, UK (REC 10/H0505/71)."	"Induced pluripotent stem cell generation  NHDF1 (from 44-year-old female) was reprogrammed with Yamanaka retroviruses SOX2, KLF4, OCT3/4, c-MYC and NANOG (Takahashi et al., 2006), and has previously been described (Hartfield et al., 2014). AD2-01 (from 51-year-old male) (Buskin et al., in preparation) and AD3-01 (from 37-year-old female) (Baud et al, 2017) were reprogrammed using the CytoTune™-iPS Reprogramming Kit (ThermoFisher). The fibroblasts to generate AD2-01 and AD3-01 were obtained from a commercial source (Lonza, CC-2511, LOT 264781).   CytoTune-iPS reprogramming was performed as directed by the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher). The CytoTune reprogramming kit contains four Sendai virus-based reprogramming vectors each capable of expressing one of the four Yamanaka factors (KLF4, OCT3/4, SOX2 and c-MYC). Briefly, after fibroblast transduction with the four Sendai virus-based reprogramming vectors, cells are cultured for 5-6 days, with medium changes every other day (DMEM, high glucose (Sigma), 10% FBS (ThermoFisher), 1% Pen/Strep (100x, ThermoFisher), 200mM L-glutamine (Sigma), 1% non-essential amino acids (ThermoFisher)). The transduced fibroblasts are then passaged using 0.05% Trpsin-EDTA onto pre-prepared feeder layer plates containing mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). 3-4 weeks after transduction, colonies should have grown to an appropriate size to allow for manual picking. Using an inverted microscope, a single colony displaying iPSC morphology is cut into 5-6 pieces using a 25 gauge needle, transferred into iPS media (KO-DMEM (ThermoFisher), 25% Knock Serum Replacement (ThermoFisher), 1% nonessential amino acids (100x, ThermoFisher), 200mM L- glutamine (Sigma), 1% Pen/Strep (100x, ThermoFisher), 8 ng/ml human FGF2 (Miltenyi Biotec)) and plated onto pre-prepared MEF plates. Colonies are allowed to attach for 48 hours, and thereafter medium changes are performed daily. iPSCs were adapted to feeder-free conditions onto Matrigel (Scientific Laboratory Supplies)-coated plates in mTeSR1 medium (ScienCell). Bulk passaging was by 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to make large-scale, quality-controlled stocks that were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. The number of feeder-free passages was kept to a minimum. When selecting iPSCs from frozen stocks for differentiation, vials with the same passage number were selected for each cell line throughout all experiments performed in this study.  The iPSC lines AD2-01 and AD3-01 were obtained through the IMI/EU sponsored StemBANCC consortium via the Human Biomaterials Resource Centre, University of Birmingham, UK (http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/facilities/hbrc).  All iPSC lines were subject to strict quality control checks before the initiation of differentiation. Quality control checks of these lines included: tests for Sendai virus clearance, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for pluripotency markers, genomic integrity checks and embryoid body tri-lineage differentiation experiments. Cells are also confirmed as negative for Mycoplasma before cryopreservation.  Sensory neuron differentiation  For neuronal differentiation, iPSCs were passaged onto Matrigel®-coated six-well plates using TrypLE express (ThermoFisher Scientific) and maintained in mTeSR1 supplemented with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (ScienCell). Twenty-four hours after plating, the medium was exchanged to mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) conditioned medium (ScienCell) supplemented with 10 ng/ml human recombinant FGF2. Cells were allowed to expand on MEF-conditioned medium until ∼50% confluent, at which time differentiation was started according to Chambers et al. (2012).

On Day 11, the now immature neurons were replated onto Matrigel®-coated coverslips (25 000 cells per 13 mm coverslip) in 100% N2 medium containing human recombinant NGF, GDNF, BDNF, NT3 (all at 25 ng/ml, PeproTech) and 10 μM ROCK inhibitor. CHIR99021 (3 μM) was included in the medium until Day 14, and laminin (1 μg/ml, ThermoFisher Scientific) was supplemented into the medium from Day 20 onwards. Medium changes were performed twice weekly after replating. Cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside (AraC, 2 μM, Sigma) was included in the medium for 24 h following replating to remove the few non-neuronal dividing cells remaining in the culture. This differentiation resulted in a completely pure neuronal culture with extensive arborized neurites by 3 weeks after the end of the small inhibitor stage.  Ethics statement   Human iPSC lines used in this study were derived from human skin biopsy fibroblasts, following signed informed consent. Three control cells lines were used in this study – AD2-01, AD4-01 and NHDF1. NHDF1 were reprogrammed with approval from research ethics committee: National Health Service, Health Research Authority, NRES Committee South Central, Berkshire, UK (REC 10/H0505/71)."	"Induced pluripotent stem cell generation  NHDF1 (from 44-year-old female) was reprogrammed with Yamanaka retroviruses SOX2, KLF4, OCT3/4, c-MYC and NANOG (Takahashi et al., 2006), and has previously been described (Hartfield et al., 2014). AD2-01 (from 51-year-old male) (Buskin et al., in preparation) and AD3-01 (from 37-year-old female) (Baud et al, 2017) were reprogrammed using the CytoTune™-iPS Reprogramming Kit (ThermoFisher). The fibroblasts to generate AD2-01 and AD3-01 were obtained from a commercial source (Lonza, CC-2511, LOT 264781).   CytoTune-iPS reprogramming was performed as directed by the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher). The CytoTune reprogramming kit contains four Sendai virus-based reprogramming vectors each capable of expressing one of the four Yamanaka factors (KLF4, OCT3/4, SOX2 and c-MYC). Briefly, after fibroblast transduction with the four Sendai virus-based reprogramming vectors, cells are cultured for 5-6 days, with medium changes every other day (DMEM, high glucose (Sigma), 10% FBS (ThermoFisher), 1% Pen/Strep (100x, ThermoFisher), 200mM L-glutamine (Sigma), 1% non-essential amino acids (ThermoFisher)). The transduced fibroblasts are then passaged using 0.05% Trpsin-EDTA onto pre-prepared feeder layer plates containing mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). 3-4 weeks after transduction, colonies should have grown to an appropriate size to allow for manual picking. Using an inverted microscope, a single colony displaying iPSC morphology is cut into 5-6 pieces using a 25 gauge needle, transferred into iPS media (KO-DMEM (ThermoFisher), 25% Knock Serum Replacement (ThermoFisher), 1% nonessential amino acids (100x, ThermoFisher), 200mM L- glutamine (Sigma), 1% Pen/Strep (100x, ThermoFisher), 8 ng/ml human FGF2 (Miltenyi Biotec)) and plated onto pre-prepared MEF plates. Colonies are allowed to attach for 48 hours, and thereafter medium changes are performed daily. iPSCs were adapted to feeder-free conditions onto Matrigel (Scientific Laboratory Supplies)-coated plates in mTeSR1 medium (ScienCell). Bulk passaging was by 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to make large-scale, quality-controlled stocks that were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. The number of feeder-free passages was kept to a minimum. When selecting iPSCs from frozen stocks for differentiation, vials with the same passage number were selected for each cell line throughout all experiments performed in this study.  The iPSC lines AD2-01 and AD3-01 were obtained through the IMI/EU sponsored StemBANCC consortium via the Human Biomaterials Resource Centre, University of Birmingham, UK (http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/facilities/hbrc).  All iPSC lines were subject to strict quality control checks before the initiation of differentiation. Quality control checks of these lines included: tests for Sendai virus clearance, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for pluripotency markers, genomic integrity checks and embryoid body tri-lineage differentiation experiments. Cells are also confirmed as negative for Mycoplasma before cryopreservation.  Sensory neuron differentiation  For neuronal differentiation, iPSCs were passaged onto Matrigel®-coated six-well plates using TrypLE express (ThermoFisher Scientific) and maintained in mTeSR1 supplemented with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (ScienCell). Twenty-four hours after plating, the medium was exchanged to mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) conditioned medium (ScienCell) supplemented with 10 ng/ml human recombinant FGF2. Cells were allowed to expand on MEF-conditioned medium until ∼50% confluent, at which time differentiation was started according to Chambers et al. (2012). Briefly, medium was exchanged to knockout serum replacement (KSR) medium containing; knockout-DMEM, 15% knockout-serum replacement, 1% GlutaMAX™, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 μM β-mercaptoethanol, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (ThermoFisher Scientific), supplemented with the SMAD inhibitors SB431542 (Sigma, 10 μM) and LDN-193189 (Stratech, 100 nM).

CHIR99021 (3 μM) was included in the medium until Day 14, and laminin (1 μg/ml, ThermoFisher Scientific) was supplemented into the medium from Day 20 onwards. Medium changes were performed twice weekly after replating. Cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside (AraC, 2 μM, Sigma) was included in the medium for 24 h following replating to remove the few non-neuronal dividing cells remaining in the culture. This differentiation resulted in a completely pure neuronal culture with extensive arborized neurites by 3 weeks after the end of the small inhibitor stage.  Ethics statement   Human iPSC lines used in this study were derived from human skin biopsy fibroblasts, following signed informed consent. Three control cells lines were used in this study – AD2-01, AD4-01 and NHDF1. NHDF1 were reprogrammed with approval from research ethics committee: National Health Service, Health Research Authority, NRES Committee South Central, Berkshire, UK (REC 10/H0505/71)."	"Induced pluripotent stem cell generation  NHDF1 (from 44-year-old female) was reprogrammed with Yamanaka retroviruses SOX2, KLF4, OCT3/4, c-MYC and NANOG (Takahashi et al., 2006), and has previously been described (Hartfield et al., 2014). AD2-01 (from 51-year-old male) (Buskin et al., in preparation) and AD3-01 (from 37-year-old female) (Baud et al, 2017) were reprogrammed using the CytoTune™-iPS Reprogramming Kit (ThermoFisher). The fibroblasts to generate AD2-01 and AD3-01 were obtained from a commercial source (Lonza, CC-2511, LOT 264781).   CytoTune-iPS reprogramming was performed as directed by the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher). The CytoTune reprogramming kit contains four Sendai virus-based reprogramming vectors each capable of expressing one of the four Yamanaka factors (KLF4, OCT3/4, SOX2 and c-MYC). Briefly, after fibroblast transduction with the four Sendai virus-based reprogramming vectors, cells are cultured for 5-6 days, with medium changes every other day (DMEM, high glucose (Sigma), 10% FBS (ThermoFisher), 1% Pen/Strep (100x, ThermoFisher), 200mM L-glutamine (Sigma), 1% non-essential amino acids (ThermoFisher)). The transduced fibroblasts are then passaged using 0.05% Trpsin-EDTA onto pre-prepared feeder layer plates containing mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). 3-4 weeks after transduction, colonies should have grown to an appropriate size to allow for manual picking. Using an inverted microscope, a single colony displaying iPSC morphology is cut into 5-6 pieces using a 25 gauge needle, transferred into iPS media (KO-DMEM (ThermoFisher), 25% Knock Serum Replacement (ThermoFisher), 1% nonessential amino acids (100x, ThermoFisher), 200mM L- glutamine (Sigma), 1% Pen/Strep (100x, ThermoFisher), 8 ng/ml human FGF2 (Miltenyi Biotec)) and plated onto pre-prepared MEF plates. Colonies are allowed to attach for 48 hours, and thereafter medium changes are performed daily. iPSCs were adapted to feeder-free conditions onto Matrigel (Scientific Laboratory Supplies)-coated plates in mTeSR1 medium (ScienCell). Bulk passaging was by 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to make large-scale, quality-controlled stocks that were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. The number of feeder-free passages was kept to a minimum. When selecting iPSCs from frozen stocks for differentiation, vials with the same passage number were selected for each cell line throughout all experiments performed in this study.  The iPSC lines AD2-01 and AD3-01 were obtained through the IMI/EU sponsored StemBANCC consortium via the Human Biomaterials Resource Centre, University of Birmingham, UK (http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/facilities/hbrc).  All iPSC lines were subject to strict quality control checks before the initiation of differentiation. Quality control checks of these lines included: tests for Sendai virus clearance, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for pluripotency markers, genomic integrity checks and embryoid body tri-lineage differentiation experiments. Cells are also confirmed as negative for Mycoplasma before cryopreservation.  Sensory neuron differentiation  For neuronal differentiation, iPSCs were passaged onto Matrigel®-coated six-well plates using TrypLE express (ThermoFisher Scientific) and maintained in mTeSR1 supplemented with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (ScienCell). Twenty-four hours after plating, the medium was exchanged to mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) conditioned medium (ScienCell) supplemented with 10 ng/ml human recombinant FGF2. Cells were allowed to expand on MEF-conditioned medium until ∼50% confluent, at which time differentiation was started according to Chambers et al. (2012). Briefly, medium was exchanged to knockout serum replacement (KSR) medium containing; knockout-DMEM, 15% knockout-serum replacement, 1% GlutaMAX™, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 μM β-mercaptoethanol, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (ThermoFisher Scientific), supplemented with the SMAD inhibitors SB431542 (Sigma, 10 μM) and LDN-193189 (Stratech, 100 nM). The medium was gradually transitioned from KSR medium to N2 medium (Neurobasal® medium, 2% B27 supplement, 1% N2 supplement, 1% GlutaMAX™, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic) (ThermoFisher Scientific) over an 11-day period.

Cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside (AraC, 2 μM, Sigma) was included in the medium for 24 h following replating to remove the few non-neuronal dividing cells remaining in the culture. This differentiation resulted in a completely pure neuronal culture with extensive arborized neurites by 3 weeks after the end of the small inhibitor stage.  Ethics statement   Human iPSC lines used in this study were derived from human skin biopsy fibroblasts, following signed informed consent. Three control cells lines were used in this study – AD2-01, AD4-01 and NHDF1. NHDF1 were reprogrammed with approval from research ethics committee: National Health Service, Health Research Authority, NRES Committee South Central, Berkshire, UK (REC 10/H0505/71)."	"Induced pluripotent stem cell generation  NHDF1 (from 44-year-old female) was reprogrammed with Yamanaka retroviruses SOX2, KLF4, OCT3/4, c-MYC and NANOG (Takahashi et al., 2006), and has previously been described (Hartfield et al., 2014). AD2-01 (from 51-year-old male) (Buskin et al., in preparation) and AD3-01 (from 37-year-old female) (Baud et al, 2017) were reprogrammed using the CytoTune™-iPS Reprogramming Kit (ThermoFisher). The fibroblasts to generate AD2-01 and AD3-01 were obtained from a commercial source (Lonza, CC-2511, LOT 264781).   CytoTune-iPS reprogramming was performed as directed by the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher). The CytoTune reprogramming kit contains four Sendai virus-based reprogramming vectors each capable of expressing one of the four Yamanaka factors (KLF4, OCT3/4, SOX2 and c-MYC). Briefly, after fibroblast transduction with the four Sendai virus-based reprogramming vectors, cells are cultured for 5-6 days, with medium changes every other day (DMEM, high glucose (Sigma), 10% FBS (ThermoFisher), 1% Pen/Strep (100x, ThermoFisher), 200mM L-glutamine (Sigma), 1% non-essential amino acids (ThermoFisher)). The transduced fibroblasts are then passaged using 0.05% Trpsin-EDTA onto pre-prepared feeder layer plates containing mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). 3-4 weeks after transduction, colonies should have grown to an appropriate size to allow for manual picking. Using an inverted microscope, a single colony displaying iPSC morphology is cut into 5-6 pieces using a 25 gauge needle, transferred into iPS media (KO-DMEM (ThermoFisher), 25% Knock Serum Replacement (ThermoFisher), 1% nonessential amino acids (100x, ThermoFisher), 200mM L- glutamine (Sigma), 1% Pen/Strep (100x, ThermoFisher), 8 ng/ml human FGF2 (Miltenyi Biotec)) and plated onto pre-prepared MEF plates. Colonies are allowed to attach for 48 hours, and thereafter medium changes are performed daily. iPSCs were adapted to feeder-free conditions onto Matrigel (Scientific Laboratory Supplies)-coated plates in mTeSR1 medium (ScienCell). Bulk passaging was by 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to make large-scale, quality-controlled stocks that were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. The number of feeder-free passages was kept to a minimum. When selecting iPSCs from frozen stocks for differentiation, vials with the same passage number were selected for each cell line throughout all experiments performed in this study.  The iPSC lines AD2-01 and AD3-01 were obtained through the IMI/EU sponsored StemBANCC consortium via the Human Biomaterials Resource Centre, University of Birmingham, UK (http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/facilities/hbrc).  All iPSC lines were subject to strict quality control checks before the initiation of differentiation. Quality control checks of these lines included: tests for Sendai virus clearance, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for pluripotency markers, genomic integrity checks and embryoid body tri-lineage differentiation experiments. Cells are also confirmed as negative for Mycoplasma before cryopreservation.  Sensory neuron differentiation  For neuronal differentiation, iPSCs were passaged onto Matrigel®-coated six-well plates using TrypLE express (ThermoFisher Scientific) and maintained in mTeSR1 supplemented with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (ScienCell). Twenty-four hours after plating, the medium was exchanged to mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) conditioned medium (ScienCell) supplemented with 10 ng/ml human recombinant FGF2. Cells were allowed to expand on MEF-conditioned medium until ∼50% confluent, at which time differentiation was started according to Chambers et al. (2012). Briefly, medium was exchanged to knockout serum replacement (KSR) medium containing; knockout-DMEM, 15% knockout-serum replacement, 1% GlutaMAX™, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 μM β-mercaptoethanol, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (ThermoFisher Scientific), supplemented with the SMAD inhibitors SB431542 (Sigma, 10 μM) and LDN-193189 (Stratech, 100 nM). The medium was gradually transitioned from KSR medium to N2 medium (Neurobasal® medium, 2% B27 supplement, 1% N2 supplement, 1% GlutaMAX™, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic) (ThermoFisher Scientific) over an 11-day period. On Day 2, the small molecules CHIR99021 (Apollo Scientific, 3 μM), SU5402 (R&D Systems, 10 μM) and DAPT (Sigma, 10 μM) were also added. SMAD inhibitors were removed from the media from Day 6 onwards. On Day 11, the now immature neurons were replated onto Matrigel®-coated coverslips (25 000 cells per 13 mm coverslip) in 100% N2 medium containing human recombinant NGF, GDNF, BDNF, NT3 (all at 25 ng/ml, PeproTech) and 10 μM ROCK inhibitor.

"Induced pluripotent stem cell generation  NHDF1 (from 44-year-old female) was reprogrammed with Yamanaka retroviruses SOX2, KLF4, OCT3/4, c-MYC and NANOG (Takahashi et al., 2006), and has previously been described (Hartfield et al., 2014). AD2-01 (from 51-year-old male) (Buskin et al., in preparation) and AD3-01 (from 37-year-old female) (Baud et al, 2017) were reprogrammed using the CytoTune™-iPS Reprogramming Kit (ThermoFisher). The fibroblasts to generate AD2-01 and AD3-01 were obtained from a commercial source (Lonza, CC-2511, LOT 264781).   CytoTune-iPS reprogramming was performed as directed by the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher). The CytoTune reprogramming kit contains four Sendai virus-based reprogramming vectors each capable of expressing one of the four Yamanaka factors (KLF4, OCT3/4, SOX2 and c-MYC). Briefly, after fibroblast transduction with the four Sendai virus-based reprogramming vectors, cells are cultured for 5-6 days, with medium changes every other day (DMEM, high glucose (Sigma), 10% FBS (ThermoFisher), 1% Pen/Strep (100x, ThermoFisher), 200mM L-glutamine (Sigma), 1% non-essential amino acids (ThermoFisher)). The transduced fibroblasts are then passaged using 0.05% Trpsin-EDTA onto pre-prepared feeder layer plates containing mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). 3-4 weeks after transduction, colonies should have grown to an appropriate size to allow for manual picking. Using an inverted microscope, a single colony displaying iPSC morphology is cut into 5-6 pieces using a 25 gauge needle, transferred into iPS media (KO-DMEM (ThermoFisher), 25% Knock Serum Replacement (ThermoFisher), 1% nonessential amino acids (100x, ThermoFisher), 200mM L- glutamine (Sigma), 1% Pen/Strep (100x, ThermoFisher), 8 ng/ml human FGF2 (Miltenyi Biotec)) and plated onto pre-prepared MEF plates. Colonies are allowed to attach for 48 hours, and thereafter medium changes are performed daily. iPSCs were adapted to feeder-free conditions onto Matrigel (Scientific Laboratory Supplies)-coated plates in mTeSR1 medium (ScienCell). Bulk passaging was by 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to make large-scale, quality-controlled stocks that were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. The number of feeder-free passages was kept to a minimum. When selecting iPSCs from frozen stocks for differentiation, vials with the same passage number were selected for each cell line throughout all experiments performed in this study.  The iPSC lines AD2-01 and AD3-01 were obtained through the IMI/EU sponsored StemBANCC consortium via the Human Biomaterials Resource Centre, University of Birmingham, UK (http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/facilities/hbrc).  All iPSC lines were subject to strict quality control checks before the initiation of differentiation. Quality control checks of these lines included: tests for Sendai virus clearance, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for pluripotency markers, genomic integrity checks and embryoid body tri-lineage differentiation experiments. Cells are also confirmed as negative for Mycoplasma before cryopreservation.  Sensory neuron differentiation  For neuronal differentiation, iPSCs were passaged onto Matrigel®-coated six-well plates using TrypLE express (ThermoFisher Scientific) and maintained in mTeSR1 supplemented with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (ScienCell). Twenty-four hours after plating, the medium was exchanged to mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) conditioned medium (ScienCell) supplemented with 10 ng/ml human recombinant FGF2. Cells were allowed to expand on MEF-conditioned medium until ∼50% confluent, at which time differentiation was started according to Chambers et al. (2012). Briefly, medium was exchanged to knockout serum replacement (KSR) medium containing; knockout-DMEM, 15% knockout-serum replacement, 1% GlutaMAX™, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 μM β-mercaptoethanol, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (ThermoFisher Scientific), supplemented with the SMAD inhibitors SB431542 (Sigma, 10 μM) and LDN-193189 (Stratech, 100 nM). The medium was gradually transitioned from KSR medium to N2 medium (Neurobasal® medium, 2% B27 supplement, 1% N2 supplement, 1% GlutaMAX™, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic) (ThermoFisher Scientific) over an 11-day period. On Day 2, the small molecules CHIR99021 (Apollo Scientific, 3 μM), SU5402 (R&D Systems, 10 μM) and DAPT (Sigma, 10 μM) were also added. SMAD inhibitors were removed from the media from Day 6 onwards. On Day 11, the now immature neurons were replated onto Matrigel®-coated coverslips (25 000 cells per 13 mm coverslip) in 100% N2 medium containing human recombinant NGF, GDNF, BDNF, NT3 (all at 25 ng/ml, PeproTech) and 10 μM ROCK inhibitor. CHIR99021 (3 μM) was included in the medium until Day 14, and laminin (1 μg/ml, ThermoFisher Scientific) was supplemented into the medium from Day 20 onwards. Medium changes were performed twice weekly after replating. Cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside (AraC, 2 μM, Sigma) was included in the medium for 24 h following replating to remove the few non-neuronal dividing cells remaining in the culture. This differentiation resulted in a completely pure neuronal culture with extensive arborized neurites by 3 weeks after the end of the small inhibitor stage.
