!Series_summary	"Purpose: To uncover differentially-regulated transcripts and pathways/biological processes in newly-diagnosed, pediatric Crohn's disease in comparison to healthy controls."
!Series_summary	"Methods: Intestinal epithelial cells were dissociated from ileal endoscopic biopsies, and stored at -80C in RNAlater.  The polyA RNA fraction was purified, and single-end, 50 bp reads were sequenced and aligned to the Hg19 genome using the TopHat2 aligner.  Differential analysis was performed using Bioconductor packages including edgeR, where significance was defined as p<0.05 and fold change>2."
!Series_summary	"Results: We obtained 15788 reasonably-expressed transcripts that were included in differential analyses."
!Series_summary	"Conclusions: Our study characterizes the dysregulation of intestinal epithelial cells in treatment-na√Øve Crohn's disease using RNA sequencing for transcriptomic profile of cells obtained through ileal endoscopic biopsies."
