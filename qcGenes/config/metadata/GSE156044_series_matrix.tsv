!Series_summary	"A feature of Crohn's disease is the extra-intestinal manifestation of creeping fat, defined as expansion of mesenteric adipose tissue around the inflamed and fibrotic ileum. In comparison to healthy controls, we found that the greatest transcriptional changes in creeping fat are functions related to immune response to bacterial products."
!Series_overall_design	"We compared the transcriptional activity of creeping fat from four Crohn's disease patients and healthy mesenteric adipose tissues from ileal controls (IRB# Pro00048577)."
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"
