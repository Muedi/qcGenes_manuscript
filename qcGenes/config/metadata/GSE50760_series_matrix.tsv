primary colorectal cancer AMC_2-1	GSM1228184	Public on Aug 31 2014	Sep 11 2013	May 15 2019	SRA	1	primary colorectal cancer	Homo sapiens	tissue: primary colorectal cancer	ajcc stage: Stage IV	total RNA	Total RNA was isolated by RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The quality and integrity of the RNA were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining, followed by visual examination under ultraviolet light.	Sequencing library was prepared using TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation kit v2 (Illumina, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Briefly, mRNA was purified from total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads, fragmented, and converted into cDNAs. Then, adapters were ligated and the fragments were amplified on a PCR.	9606	Base calling was performed by Illumina Genome Studio(V2010.1).	A reference genome sequence data of Homo sapiens was obtained from University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser Gateway (assembly ID: hg19). Reference genome index was built by using bowtie2-build component of Bowtie2 (ver. 2.0, http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2) and SAMtools (ver. 0.1.18, http://samtools.sourceforge.net/).	To estimate average and standard deviation of fragment size of paired-end reads, reference transcriptome was generated by MakeTranscriptome component of USeq tool (ver. 8.4.4, http://useq.sourceforge.net/). Then, generated reference transcriptome was indexed by Novoindex followed by reads mapping to transcriptome and measurements of average and standard deviation of fragment size in paired-end reads using Novoalign provided by Novocraft software (ver. 2.8.3, http://www.novocraft.com/). Tophat2 was applied to tissue samples for mapping reads to reference genome and estimated average and standard deviation of fragment size of each sample were used as parameters of Tophat2.	The fragments  per  kilobase  of  transcript  per  million  fragments  mapped (FPKM) of each sample was estimated by Cufflinks software (V2.0.2).

Reference genome index was built by using bowtie2-build component of Bowtie2 (ver. 2.0, http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2) and SAMtools (ver. 0.1.18, http://samtools.sourceforge.net/).	To estimate average and standard deviation of fragment size of paired-end reads, reference transcriptome was generated by MakeTranscriptome component of USeq tool (ver. 8.4.4, http://useq.sourceforge.net/). Then, generated reference transcriptome was indexed by Novoindex followed by reads mapping to transcriptome and measurements of average and standard deviation of fragment size in paired-end reads using Novoalign provided by Novocraft software (ver. 2.8.3, http://www.novocraft.com/). Tophat2 was applied to tissue samples for mapping reads to reference genome and estimated average and standard deviation of fragment size of each sample were used as parameters of Tophat2.	The fragments  per  kilobase  of  transcript  per  million  fragments  mapped (FPKM) of each sample was estimated by Cufflinks software (V2.0.2).
