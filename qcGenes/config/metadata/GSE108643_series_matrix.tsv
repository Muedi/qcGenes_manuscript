!Series_summary	"Acute aerobic exercise has been shown to improve skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and completeness of fatty acid β-oxidation which contribute to improved insulin sensitivity. The effectiveness of acute exercise on improving mitochondrial adaptations, leading to improved insulin sensitivity, in overweight/obese (Ov/Ob) individuals is controversial. This study aimed to determine the effects of acute exercise on epigenetic regulation of genes involved in skeletal muscle mitochondrial adaptations in lean vs Ov/Ob men."
!Series_overall_design	"30 men, aged 19-30 years, were recruited and divided into two groups: lean (BMI<25, 18.5- 24.1 kg/m2, n=15) and Ov/Ob (BMI≥25, 25.5- 36.9 kg/m2, n=15). Vastus lateralis muscle biopsy samples were collected at rest, following an overnight fast (Pre; n=14 in lean Pre and n=15 in Ov/Ob Pre). Subjects then ingested a standardized high-carbohydrate breakfast (7 kcal/kg; 60% carbohydrate, 25% fat, 15% protein). Four hours later, they performed an acute bout of cycling exercise (50% VO2max, expending ~650 kcal) and vastus lateralis muscle biopsy samples were collected immediately after the exercise bout (Post; n=15 in lean Post and in Ov/Ob Post). RNA-seq via the Illumina platform was performed. Sequences were aligned using TopHat and differential gene expression determined using Cuffdiff."

Following an overnight fast, participants reported to the Purdue University Nutrition Science Bionutrition Core between 0700 and 1000 h where they sat quietly for 15 min prior to quadriceps muscle biopsy sampling (Pre samples). Participants then consumed a standardized, high carbohydrate meal (7 kcal/kg; 60% carbohydrate, 25% fat, 15% protein) under the supervision of a registered dietician. Following the meal, participants were asked to refrain from eating or drinking, with the exception of water, and to refrain from physical activity for the next 4 h, at which time they reported back to the laboratory for the exercise testing trial. For the exercise testing trail, each participant completing a 2 min warm up at a self-selected intensity not exceeding 100W on the stationery cycle ergometer. Participants then cycled at the workload equal to their previously measured 50% VO2 max. Between minutes 5-8 of the exercise testing trial, steady-state oxygen consumption was measured using the TrueOne 2400 Metabolic Measurement System (Parvo Medics, Utah, USA). Measured values were compared with the participant’s expected 50% VO2 max. Workload was adjusted as necessary to obtain the expected oxygen consumption necessary for the participants to expend 650 kcal upon completion of the exercise testing trial.

For the exercise testing trail, each participant completing a 2 min warm up at a self-selected intensity not exceeding 100W on the stationery cycle ergometer. Participants then cycled at the workload equal to their previously measured 50% VO2 max. Between minutes 5-8 of the exercise testing trial, steady-state oxygen consumption was measured using the TrueOne 2400 Metabolic Measurement System (Parvo Medics, Utah, USA). Measured values were compared with the participant’s expected 50% VO2 max. Workload was adjusted as necessary to obtain the expected oxygen consumption necessary for the participants to expend 650 kcal upon completion of the exercise testing trial. Immediately following the exercise testing trial, a second quadriceps muscle biopsy were obtained from each participant (Post samples)."	"30 men, aged 19-30 years, were recruited and divided into two groups: lean (BMI<25, 18.5- 24.1 kg/m2, n=15) and Ov/Ob (BMI≥25, 25.5- 36.9 kg/m2, n=15). Participants were instructed to refrain from vigorous physical activity for 24 h prior to the exercise testing trial. Following an overnight fast, participants reported to the Purdue University Nutrition Science Bionutrition Core between 0700 and 1000 h where they sat quietly for 15 min prior to quadriceps muscle biopsy sampling (Pre samples). Participants then consumed a standardized, high carbohydrate meal (7 kcal/kg; 60% carbohydrate, 25% fat, 15% protein) under the supervision of a registered dietician. Following the meal, participants were asked to refrain from eating or drinking, with the exception of water, and to refrain from physical activity for the next 4 h, at which time they reported back to the laboratory for the exercise testing trial.
