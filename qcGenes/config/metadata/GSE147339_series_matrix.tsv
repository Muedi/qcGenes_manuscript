!Series_summary	"De-identified RNA sequencing of whole blood in psoriasis and control participants"
!Series_overall_design	"Cross-sectional comparison of disease (psoriasis) vs. control. We report the comparison in the whole blood transcriptome inflammatory signature by RNA sequencing in psoriasis compared to control individuals. We find the inflammasome signaling pathway as the highest differentially expressed."
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"
