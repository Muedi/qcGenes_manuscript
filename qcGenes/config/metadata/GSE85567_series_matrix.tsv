!Series_summary	"We generated genome-wide RNASeq data from freshly isolated airway epithelial cells of asthmatics and non-asthmatics. This data was paired with genome-wide genetic and methylation data from the same individuals allowing for an integrated analysis of genetic, transcriptional, and epigenetic signatures in asthma."
!Series_overall_design	"examination of genome-wide genome-wide gene expression levels and comparison to phenotypes"
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"
