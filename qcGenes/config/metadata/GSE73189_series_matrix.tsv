!Series_summary	"We report abonormally expressed genes of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia by RNA-seq analysis. BMP3 was found down-regulated in idiopathic intestital pneumonia patients, and it closely correlated with pathogenesis of disease. The role of BMP3 in advancement of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia was verified by a series of experiments."
