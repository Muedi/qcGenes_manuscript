!Series_summary	"We present an infection study with pathogenic and non-pathogenic mycobacterial strains that have vastly different characteristics. The early/late host response to infection with these detergent-free cultured strains will be analysed through Ampliseq and further validated through qPCR in an attempt to provide information on the subtleties which may ultimately contribute to the virulent phenotype. Proceeding to the next objective of the study is to knock-down (siRNA)/knock-up (saRNA) selected differentially expressed mRNA to study their role in the intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis"
!Series_overall_design	"PBMC isolated from human blood, infected with either pathogenic (R179) or non-pathogenic (M. bovis BCG or M. Smegmatis). Total RNA extracted and subjected to Ion AmpliSeq to detect differentially expressed genes. DE genes detected was validated using qPCR"
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"
