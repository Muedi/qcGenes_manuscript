!Series_summary	"Background:This study was a hypothesis generating exploration of genomic data collected at diagnosis for 19 patients, who later participated in a clinical trial. BRCA1/2 germline mutation related hereditary cancers are candidates for new immune therapeutic interventions. However, contrary to what is expected of tumors with compromised DNA repair, a prominent tumor mutation burden (TMB) in hereditary breast and ovarian cancers in this cohort, was not correlated with high global immune activity in their microenvironments. More information is needed about the relationship between genomic instability, phenotypes and immune microenvironments of BRCA1/2 related hereditary tumors in order to find appropriate markers of immune activity and the most effective anticancer immune strategies."
!Series_summary	"Methods:Mining and statistical analyses of the original DNA and RNA sequencing data and data available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were performed using the R computing environment. To interpret the data, we have used published literature and web available resources such as Gene Ontology Tools, The Cancer immunome Atlas (TCIA) and the Cancer Research Institute iAtlas."
!Series_summary	"Results: We found that BRCA1/2 germline related breast and ovarian cancers do not represent a unique phenotypic identity, but that they express a range of phenotypes similar to sporadic cancers. Importantly, BRCA2 germline mutation related breast tumors have a different profile of genomic instability compared to those related to BRCA1. However, all breast and ovarian BRCA1/2 related tumors are characterized by high homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and low aneuploidy. Interestingly, all sporadic high grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC) and most of the subtypes of triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), but not other types of breast cancer, also express a high degree of HRD."
!Series_summary	"Conclusion: : Tumor mutation burdon (TMB) is not associated with the magnitude of the immune response in hereditary BRCA1/2 related breast and ovarian cancers or in sporadic TNBC and sporadic HGSOC. Hereditary tumors express phenotypes as heterogenous as sporadic tumors with various degree of “BRCAness” and various characteristics of the immune microenvironments. The subtyping criteria developed for sporadic tumors can be applied for the classification of hereditary tumors and possibly also characterization of their immune microenvironment. A high HRD score may be a good candidate biomarker for response to platinum, and potentially PARP-inhibition."
