The amplified cDNA libraries were purified using Nucleic Acid binding beads, binding buffers and run on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer to determine the yield and size distribution of each library.For all the DNA libraries, further template amplification and enrichment were performed on the Ion Chef system followed by sequencing on an Ion Proton sequencer (PrimBio Research Institute LLC ,Exton, PA).	9606	Prewound side of Volunteer #8	IonTorrent software was used for base-calling.	The raw sequences were aligned to the human hg19   reference sequence by  Ion Torrent Suite alignment tool	Quality control was assessed by the StrandNGS program, which determined the pre- and post-alignment quality of the reads for each sample.
