!Series_summary	"Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) are classified as M1 (“anti-tumour”) and M2 (“pro-tumour”), but their balance has not yet been accurately established in human cancer tissue. Here, we present bulk and single-cell transcriptomic data from human TAMs isolated from lung cancer compared with autologous non-tumour involved lung tissue macrophages (N-TAM). TAMs have a profoundly different transcriptomic profile from N-TAMs and displayed a broad M2 pro-tumour signature that was homogeneous across all the lung cancer patients studied. However, in some tumours, we found TAM populations that simultaneously displayed strong M1 gene expression pattern. These M1hot TAMs appeared to contribute to effective anti-tumour immunity via expression of T cell chemo-attractants (CXCL9, 10 and 11). We found that M1hot TAMs expressed low levels of FABP3, 4 and 5, take up less fatty acids and showed “metabolic generosity” to tissue resident memory T cells (TRM) by allowing them access to this essential nutrient resource that is required for their maintenance. Importantly, tumours harbouring M1hot TAMs were highly enriched for TRM cells and were also associated with improved overall survival outcomes. Our findings suggest that immunotherapeutic approaches aimed at inducing the expression of M1hot program in TAMs rather than generically eliminating all TAMs are likely to be beneficial."

Briefly: Samples were subjected to End-Repair during 30 min at 30C. Size selection was performed using Agencourt AMPure XP beads in two steps: Removal of large DNA fragments (>450 bp) followed by removal of small DNA fragments (<150 bp). 3’ ends of 150-450bp DNA fragments were adenylated using A-Tailing Mix during 30 min at 37C. Then, Illumina adapters were ligated using Ligation Mix 2, Resuspension Buffer and the appropriate barcoded adapter in each case. As a last step, two sets of clean ups were performed using AMPure XP Beads. DNA was eluted and PCR amplified using PCR Primer Cocktail and Enhanced PCR Mix as follows: 3 min at 95C, and 8 cycles of 20 sec at 98C, 15 sec at 60C and 30 sec at 70C.
