!Series_summary	"Our data analysis unveils that differentially expressed long noncoding RNAs and some wrongly transcribed noncoding transcripts have potential DNA binding sites at promoters of differentially expressed or wrongly transcribed coding transcripts, gains and losses of differentially methylated DNA regions also occur at relevant sites, but less specifically. Moreover, both differentially expressed or wrongly transcribed transcripts and gains and losses of differentially methylated DNA regions show significant case-to-case variation."
