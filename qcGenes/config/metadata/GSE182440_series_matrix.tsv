!Series_summary	"Purpose: The goal of this study to examine mRNA transcriptomic changes in reward-related brain regions of subjects with alcohol use disorder."
!Series_summary	"Methods: Total RNAs were extracted from postmortem putamen of 12 AUD and 12 control subjects. rRNA depletion RNA sequencing was performed and the sequence reads were processed using the bulk RNA-seq processing pipeline Pipeliner workflow (Federico et al. Front Genet 2019; 10, 614). AUD-associated mRNA transcriptomic changes were analyzed by the Limma-Voom method."
!Series_summary	"Results: Differentially expressed mRNAs (absolute FC>2.0 & P<0.05) were identified in postmortem putamen of subjects with alcohol use disorder (AUD)."
!Series_summary	"Chronic alcohol consumption may alter mRNA transcriptome profiles in reward-related brain regions, resulting in alcohol-induced neuroadaptations."
!Series_overall_design	"Cases and controls were matched by race, sex, age, etc."
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"
