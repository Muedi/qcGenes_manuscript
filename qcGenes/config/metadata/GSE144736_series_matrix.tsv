!Series_summary	"Microdeletions and microduplications of the 16p11.2 chromosomal locus are implicated in a collection of  neurodevelopmental disorders and reciprocal physiological conditions such as macro/microcephaly and high/low  body mass index. To facilitate cellular and molecular investigations of these phenotypes, we generated 65 clones  of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from 13 individuals with 16p11.2 copy number variations  (CNVs) and made each clone available by request from the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative  (SFARI). Here we report on pluripotency, vector silencing, CNV breakpoint location, inter-clonal relatedness, and  differentiation capacity for a majority of the available hiPSC clones. Comprehensive demographic and diagnostic  data were collected and tabulated to facilitate investigation across a spectrum of pathologies. We demonstrate a  customizable bioinformatic strategy for enhanced detection of the effects of episomal reprogramming and use this  tool to identify a subset of clones free of off-target effects on neural progenitor gene transcription and phenotypic  variation . With cortical neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from these hiPSCs, we identified a set of genes  modulated by 16p11.2 deletion that precede morphological abnormalities reported at more mature developmental  stages. This publicly available resource of 65 human hiPSC clones will serve as a powerful medium for probing  the etiology of developmental disorders associated with 16p11.2 CNVs."
!Series_overall_design	"2 or more clones derived from patient iPSCs were analyzed with RNA-Seq for integration status (Integration+ or Integration-) or genotype (DEL or WT). Sequencing data were collected in two different batches. Number of clones and patients varies according to analysis."

These vectors are pCXLE-hOCT3/4-shp53-F (Addgene Plasmid 27077), pCXLE-hSK (Addgene Plasmid 27078), and pCXLE-hUL (Addgene Plasmid 27080). 6 µg of total plasmid DNA (2 µg for each of the three episomal vectors) were electroporated into 5x10^5 fibroblasts with the Amaxa® Human Dermal Fibroblast Nucleofector® Kit (Lonza, VDP-1001). As previously reported, hiPSCs were differentiated in N3 culture medium which consists of DMEM/F12 (1x, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11320033), Neurobasal (1x, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 21103049), N-2 Supplement (1%, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 17502048), B-27 Supplement (2%, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 17504044), GlutaMax (1%, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 35050061), MEM NEAA (1%, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11140050), and human recombinant insulin (2.5 µg/mL, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 12585014). From Day 1 to 11, the N3 media was further supplemented with two factors: SB-431542 (5 µM, Tocris, 1614) and LDN-193189 (100 nM, Stemgent, 04007402). At Day 12, the differentiating cells were dissociated with Cell Dissociation Solution (1x, Sigma-Aldrich, C5914), passaged onto Poly-D-Lysine (50 µg/mL, Sigma, P1024) and Laminin (5 µg/mL, Roche, 11243217001) coated plates, and cultured in N3 media without factors until Day 22 when they were passaged again.

As previously reported, hiPSCs were differentiated in N3 culture medium which consists of DMEM/F12 (1x, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11320033), Neurobasal (1x, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 21103049), N-2 Supplement (1%, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 17502048), B-27 Supplement (2%, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 17504044), GlutaMax (1%, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 35050061), MEM NEAA (1%, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11140050), and human recombinant insulin (2.5 µg/mL, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 12585014). From Day 1 to 11, the N3 media was further supplemented with two factors: SB-431542 (5 µM, Tocris, 1614) and LDN-193189 (100 nM, Stemgent, 04007402). At Day 12, the differentiating cells were dissociated with Cell Dissociation Solution (1x, Sigma-Aldrich, C5914), passaged onto Poly-D-Lysine (50 µg/mL, Sigma, P1024) and Laminin (5 µg/mL, Roche, 11243217001) coated plates, and cultured in N3 media without factors until Day 22 when they were passaged again. Between Day 1 and Day 22, media changes were performed daily. However, after Day 22, cells were exposed to media changes every other day with N3 media without factors. Clones were grown in batches (""GrowBatch"")."
