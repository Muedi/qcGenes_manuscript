!Series_summary	"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a known risk factor for developing lung cancer suggesting that the COPD stroma contains factors supporting tumorigenesis. Since cancer initiation is complex we used a multi-omic approach to identify gene expression patterns that distinguish COPD stroma in patients with or without lung cancer. We obtained lung tissue from patients with COPD and lung cancer (tumor and adjacent non-malignant tissue) and those with COPD without lung cancer for proteomic and mRNA (cytoplasmic and polyribosomal) profiling.  We used the joint and individual variation explained (JIVE) method to integrate and analysis across the three datasets.  JIVE identified eight latent patterns that robustly distinguished and separated the three groups of tissue samples. Predictive variables that associated with the tumor, compared to adjacent stroma, were mainly represented in the transcriptomic data, whereas, predictive variables associated with adjacent tissue compared to controls was represented at the translatomic level. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed extracellular matrix (ECM) and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways as important signals in the pre-malignant stroma. COPD stroma adjacent to lung cancer is unique and differs from non-malignant COPD tissue and is distinguished by the extracellular matrix and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways."

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1	"Frozen lung tissue samples ranging in weight from 25-60 mg were individually ground to a fine powder using a liquid nitrogen cooled ceramic mortar and pestle. For RNA quality control (QC), approximately 20% of each sample was processed with TRI Reagent (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Once the initial RNA QC was completed, polyribosome preparations were performed in random sample pairs. For this purpose, the remainder of each frozen powdered sample was solubilized in 100 µL of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1% Nonidet-P40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 40 mM dithiothreitol, 500 U/mL RNAsin (Promega, Madison, WI), 40 mM VRC (vanadyl ribonucleoside complex), and 150 µg/ml cycloheximide) and mixed by pipetting. Nuclei and insoluble material were removed by centrifugation (12,000 x g, 10 seconds, at 4°C). Extraction buffer (50 µL; 0.2 M Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 0.3 M NaCl, 10 mM PMSF) was added to the supernatant and the sample was mixed by pipetting. The sample was centrifuged (12,000 x g, 5 min, at 4° C) and 25% of the supernatant was processed with TRI Reagent to generate a cytosolic total RNA sample. The remaining supernatant was layered onto a 5 mL, linear sucrose gradient (0.5–1.5 M), 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT. Gradients were centrifuged (200,000 x g in a Beckman SW55Ti rotor for 80 minutes at 4o C) and the gradients were fractionated into ten, 0.5 mL fractions utilizing an ISCO density gradient fractionator with absorbance monitored at 254 nm. Each fraction was collected into a tube containing 50 µL 1%SDS and 20 µL 0.5 M EDTA. The polyribosomal mRNA from fractions 7, 8, 9 and 10 were individually processed with 1 mL of TRI Reagent and 200 µL chloroform and the resultant RNA pellets from these four fractions were combined to create the polyribosomal mRNA sample corresponding to each tissue sample. Polyribosomal mRNA and cytosolic RNA were sent to the University of Minnesota Genomics Core for quality assessment by Caliper High Sensitivity Lab Chip. Those samples passing the Caliper QC were processed into indexed library samples for analysis by RNA sequencing. This was accomplished using the SMART-Seq protocol."

Those samples passing the Caliper QC were processed into indexed library samples for analysis by RNA sequencing. This was accomplished using the SMART-Seq protocol."	"Frozen lung tissue samples ranging in weight from 25-60 mg were individually ground to a fine powder using a liquid nitrogen cooled ceramic mortar and pestle. For RNA quality control (QC), approximately 20% of each sample was processed with TRI Reagent (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Once the initial RNA QC was completed, polyribosome preparations were performed in random sample pairs. For this purpose, the remainder of each frozen powdered sample was solubilized in 100 µL of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1% Nonidet-P40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 40 mM dithiothreitol, 500 U/mL RNAsin (Promega, Madison, WI), 40 mM VRC (vanadyl ribonucleoside complex), and 150 µg/ml cycloheximide) and mixed by pipetting. Nuclei and insoluble material were removed by centrifugation (12,000 x g, 10 seconds, at 4°C). Extraction buffer (50 µL; 0.2 M Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 0.3 M NaCl, 10 mM PMSF) was added to the supernatant and the sample was mixed by pipetting. The sample was centrifuged (12,000 x g, 5 min, at 4° C) and 25% of the supernatant was processed with TRI Reagent to generate a cytosolic total RNA sample. The remaining supernatant was layered onto a 5 mL, linear sucrose gradient (0.5–1.5 M), 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT. Gradients were centrifuged (200,000 x g in a Beckman SW55Ti rotor for 80 minutes at 4o C) and the gradients were fractionated into ten, 0.5 mL fractions utilizing an ISCO density gradient fractionator with absorbance monitored at 254 nm.

The sample was centrifuged (12,000 x g, 5 min, at 4° C) and 25% of the supernatant was processed with TRI Reagent to generate a cytosolic total RNA sample. The remaining supernatant was layered onto a 5 mL, linear sucrose gradient (0.5–1.5 M), 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT. Gradients were centrifuged (200,000 x g in a Beckman SW55Ti rotor for 80 minutes at 4o C) and the gradients were fractionated into ten, 0.5 mL fractions utilizing an ISCO density gradient fractionator with absorbance monitored at 254 nm. Each fraction was collected into a tube containing 50 µL 1%SDS and 20 µL 0.5 M EDTA. The polyribosomal mRNA from fractions 7, 8, 9 and 10 were individually processed with 1 mL of TRI Reagent and 200 µL chloroform and the resultant RNA pellets from these four fractions were combined to create the polyribosomal mRNA sample corresponding to each tissue sample. Polyribosomal mRNA and cytosolic RNA were sent to the University of Minnesota Genomics Core for quality assessment by Caliper High Sensitivity Lab Chip. Those samples passing the Caliper QC were processed into indexed library samples for analysis by RNA sequencing. This was accomplished using the SMART-Seq protocol."

"Frozen lung tissue samples ranging in weight from 25-60 mg were individually ground to a fine powder using a liquid nitrogen cooled ceramic mortar and pestle. For RNA quality control (QC), approximately 20% of each sample was processed with TRI Reagent (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Once the initial RNA QC was completed, polyribosome preparations were performed in random sample pairs. For this purpose, the remainder of each frozen powdered sample was solubilized in 100 µL of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1% Nonidet-P40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 40 mM dithiothreitol, 500 U/mL RNAsin (Promega, Madison, WI), 40 mM VRC (vanadyl ribonucleoside complex), and 150 µg/ml cycloheximide) and mixed by pipetting. Nuclei and insoluble material were removed by centrifugation (12,000 x g, 10 seconds, at 4°C). Extraction buffer (50 µL; 0.2 M Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 0.3 M NaCl, 10 mM PMSF) was added to the supernatant and the sample was mixed by pipetting. The sample was centrifuged (12,000 x g, 5 min, at 4° C) and 25% of the supernatant was processed with TRI Reagent to generate a cytosolic total RNA sample. The remaining supernatant was layered onto a 5 mL, linear sucrose gradient (0.5–1.5 M), 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT. Gradients were centrifuged (200,000 x g in a Beckman SW55Ti rotor for 80 minutes at 4o C) and the gradients were fractionated into ten, 0.5 mL fractions utilizing an ISCO density gradient fractionator with absorbance monitored at 254 nm. Each fraction was collected into a tube containing 50 µL 1%SDS and 20 µL 0.5 M EDTA. The polyribosomal mRNA from fractions 7, 8, 9 and 10 were individually processed with 1 mL of TRI Reagent and 200 µL chloroform and the resultant RNA pellets from these four fractions were combined to create the polyribosomal mRNA sample corresponding to each tissue sample.

The remaining supernatant was layered onto a 5 mL, linear sucrose gradient (0.5–1.5 M), 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT. Gradients were centrifuged (200,000 x g in a Beckman SW55Ti rotor for 80 minutes at 4o C) and the gradients were fractionated into ten, 0.5 mL fractions utilizing an ISCO density gradient fractionator with absorbance monitored at 254 nm. Each fraction was collected into a tube containing 50 µL 1%SDS and 20 µL 0.5 M EDTA. The polyribosomal mRNA from fractions 7, 8, 9 and 10 were individually processed with 1 mL of TRI Reagent and 200 µL chloroform and the resultant RNA pellets from these four fractions were combined to create the polyribosomal mRNA sample corresponding to each tissue sample. Polyribosomal mRNA and cytosolic RNA were sent to the University of Minnesota Genomics Core for quality assessment by Caliper High Sensitivity Lab Chip. Those samples passing the Caliper QC were processed into indexed library samples for analysis by RNA sequencing. This was accomplished using the SMART-Seq protocol."

For RNA quality control (QC), approximately 20% of each sample was processed with TRI Reagent (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Once the initial RNA QC was completed, polyribosome preparations were performed in random sample pairs. For this purpose, the remainder of each frozen powdered sample was solubilized in 100 µL of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1% Nonidet-P40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 40 mM dithiothreitol, 500 U/mL RNAsin (Promega, Madison, WI), 40 mM VRC (vanadyl ribonucleoside complex), and 150 µg/ml cycloheximide) and mixed by pipetting. Nuclei and insoluble material were removed by centrifugation (12,000 x g, 10 seconds, at 4°C). Extraction buffer (50 µL; 0.2 M Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 0.3 M NaCl, 10 mM PMSF) was added to the supernatant and the sample was mixed by pipetting. The sample was centrifuged (12,000 x g, 5 min, at 4° C) and 25% of the supernatant was processed with TRI Reagent to generate a cytosolic total RNA sample. The remaining supernatant was layered onto a 5 mL, linear sucrose gradient (0.5–1.5 M), 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT. Gradients were centrifuged (200,000 x g in a Beckman SW55Ti rotor for 80 minutes at 4o C) and the gradients were fractionated into ten, 0.5 mL fractions utilizing an ISCO density gradient fractionator with absorbance monitored at 254 nm. Each fraction was collected into a tube containing 50 µL 1%SDS and 20 µL 0.5 M EDTA. The polyribosomal mRNA from fractions 7, 8, 9 and 10 were individually processed with 1 mL of TRI Reagent and 200 µL chloroform and the resultant RNA pellets from these four fractions were combined to create the polyribosomal mRNA sample corresponding to each tissue sample.
