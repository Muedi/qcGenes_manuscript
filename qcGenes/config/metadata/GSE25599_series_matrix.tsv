!Series_summary	"RNA-seq is a powerful tool for comprehensive characterization of whole transcriptome at both gene and exon levels and with a unique ability of identifying novel splicing variants. To date, RNA-seq analysis of HBV-related HCC has not been reported. In this study, we performed transcriptome analyses for 10 matched pairs of cancer and non-cancerous tissues from Chinese HBV-related hepatocelluar carcinoma patients using 36bp single-end sequencing approach on Solexa/Illumina GAII platform. On average, about 21.6 million sequencing reads and 10.6 million aligned reads were obtained for samples sequenced on each lane, which was able to identify > 50% of all the annotated genes for each sample. Furthermore, from by far the largest database of transcripts expressed in HCC tissues, we identified 1,378 significantly differently expressed genes (DEGs) and 24, 338 differentially expressed exons (DEEs). Comprehensive function analyses indicated that cell growth-related, metabolism-related and immune-related pathways were most significantly enriched by DEGs, pointing to a complex mechanism for HCC carcinogenesis. Positional gene enrichment analysis showed that DEGs were most significantly enriched at chromosome 8q21.3-24.3. The most interesting findings were from the analysis at exon levels where we characterized three major patterns of expression changes between gene levels and exon levels, implying a much complex landscape of transcript-specific differential expressions in HCC. Finally, we identified a novel highly up-regulated exon-exon junction in ATAD2 (ATPase family, AAA domain containing 2) gene in HCC tissues. Overall, to our best knowledge, our study represents the most comprehensive characterization of the HBV-related HCC transcriptome including exon level expression changes and novel splicing variants, which illustrated the power of RNA-seq and provided important clues for understanding the molecular mechanisms of HCC pathogenesis at system-wide levels."

!Sample_data_processing	"All alignments were performed using a tool package SOAP2, a program specially designed for next-generation sequencing analysis, allowing up to 2 mismatches. Sequenced reads were respectively aligned to human transcript reference sequences from ENSEMBL database (build 55) for expression evaluation at the level of gene or exon. Reads that unable to be mapped to transcriptome were also aligned to novel exon-exon junction database that was previously developed by our group for detection of new alternative splicing events.After alignment to the transcriptome, the expression level of genes was determined based on the value of RPKM (reads per kilobase per million), which was calculated as the number of reads mapped to the transcripts of one gene divided by the transcript length and the number of total mapped reads in one sample. The expression level of each exon or exon-exon junction was also evaluated by RPKM, similarly calculated as the number of reads mapped to unique exon divided by the exon length and the number of total mapped reads in one sample. Three kinds of statistical analyses were applied to estimate the significance of expression difference, including paired t-test and paired wilcoxon signed rank test based on RPKM value, and a recently proposed software package edgeR (a program specifically designed for analyzing RNA-seq data ) based on read count. The difference with P <0.05 for t test and wilcoxon signed rank test and FDR<0.05 for edgeR was considered as significant. To assess the distribution of DEGs at different expression abundance levels, MA-plot was made."
