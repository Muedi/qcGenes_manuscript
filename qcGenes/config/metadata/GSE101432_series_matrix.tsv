!Series_summary	"The complexity of transcriptome in human liver has not been clarified quite clearly so far. Here we collect various types of liver samples, including primary tumor, relapse tumor, benign adjacent, normal liver and tumor cell lines.High-throughput RNA sequecing data was generated for each sample.We assembled transcripts from these data under the guidance of GENCODE transcript annotation (v22).After the assembly, 94,272 genes and 371,388 transcripts were identified. Furthermore, we identified alternative splicing events from these genes and transcripts."
!Series_overall_design	"Illuminate the complexity of liver transcriptome through high-throughput sequencing data."
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"
