!Series_summary	"Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the predominant pediatric liver cancer with limited therapeutic options for patients with aggressive tumors. Nevertheless, it is a rare disease. Here, we performed a high-throughput molecular study of 32 patients with HB and major findings were validated in additional 80 cases. We unveiled an epigenetic footprint including downregulation of RNA-editing, hyperediting of the tumor suppressor BLCAP,14q32 DLK1-DIO3 locus overexpression, DNA hypomethylation and CpG island hypermethylation. Based on these findings, we defined an integrative molecular classification of HB that improve current clinical stratification, and identified CHKA as a therapeutic target for the poor prognostic subclass."
!Series_overall_design	"66 RNA samples sequenced from 32 patients with hepatoblastoma."
