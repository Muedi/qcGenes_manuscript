!Series_summary	"Enhancer aberrations are beginning to emerge as a key feature of colorectal cancers, however, we have limited understanding of epigenomic patterns that distinguish tumors and underlying heterogeneity between tumors. Here, using epigenomic profiling of colorectal tumors, adenomas and normal colon tissues, we identify unique pattern of regulatory elements in colorectal cancer, which could reliably distinguish tumors from normal colon specimens. We define shared and unique enhancer elements during colorectal cancer progression using normal adjacent colon, adenomas and adenocarcinomas. We validate the functional nature of tumor-specific enhancers for important oncogenes such as ASCL2 and Fzd10. NMF clustering identified 4 epigenetic (EPIC) subtypes in colorectal cancer, which mimics consensus molecular subtypes (CMS)1, with an advantage of introducing a novel epigenetically-identifiable subtype with poor prognosis and survival. Based on this correlation, we defined and validated a combination therapeutic strategy of enhancer-blocking BETi with pathway specific inhibitor for 3 CMS subtypes. In conclusion, by comprehensive characterization of chromatin state patterns in colorectal tumors, we define epigenomic patterns during tumor evolution, heterogeneity of enhancers among patients and a combination therapy strategy for CMS-subgroups."

Genes with raw mean reads greater than 10 were used for normalization and differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2 package in R. Wald test defined in the DESeq function of the package was used for differential expression analysis and shrunken log fold-changes (i.e., obtaining reliable variance estimates by pooling information across all the genes) were used for further analysis. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering plots (hclust) and XY plots between replicates of same genotypes were used to examine for nominal amounts of non-technical variation and other latent factors. PCA, hclust and bar plots were generated using ggplot2 (Wickham). All the heatmaps of differentially expressed genes were generated using pheatmap package (Kolde, 2012) in R environment."
