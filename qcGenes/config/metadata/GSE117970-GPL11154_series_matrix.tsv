!Series_summary	"The roles of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and circulating monocytes in human cancer are poorly understood. Here, we show that monocyte subpopulation distribution and transcriptomes are significantly altered by the presence of endometrial and breast cancer. Furthermore, TAMs from endometrial and breast cancers are transcriptionally distinct from monocytes and their respective tissue-resident macrophages. We identified a breast TAM signature that is highly enriched in aggressive breast cancer subtypes and associated with shorter disease-specific survival. We also identified an auto-regulatory loop between TAMs and cancer cells driven by tumor necrosis factor alpha involving SIGLEC1 and CCL8, which is self- reinforcing through the production of CSF1. Together these data provide direct evidence that monocyte and macrophage transcriptional landscapes are perturbed by cancer, reflecting patient outcomes."

!Sample_data_processing	"FastQ files of 2x100bp paired-end reads were quality checked using FastQC. Samples were filtered for low quality reads (Phred score >= 20) and adapters were removed when necessary using Cutadapt. Quality controlled reads were then aligned to the Human reference genome (GRCh37/hg19) using STAR aligner (Dobin et al., 2013) (version 2.3). Quantification of genes was performed using the count function of HTSeq (Anders et al., 2015). Reads were counted at the gene level and the unstranded option was used (-s no)."
