!Series_summary	"Purpose: The goals of this study are to characterize the transcriptional dysregulation of GIST. More importantly, the transcriptome differences betweeen Imatinib-sensitive and resistant patients are compared to identify RNAs that may impact Imatinib resistance."
!Series_summary	"Methods: High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was employed to capture the transcriptional changes in GIST compared to normal samples. RSEM was used to quantify gene expression and DESeq2 was utilized to compared expression changes between different sample groups."
