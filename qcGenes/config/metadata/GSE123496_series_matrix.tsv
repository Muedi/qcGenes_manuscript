!Series_summary	"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by cell proliferation, migration and damage in various cell types in different CNS regions and causes disabilities related to distinct neurological pathways, such as walking, vision and cognition. Here, region-specific transcriptomic approach was used to determine changes in gene expression in five different CNS regions (hippocampus, frontal cortex, internal capsule, corpus callosum, and parietal cortex) in MS."
!Series_overall_design	"Five MS patients (average age = 57.6 years) and five age-matched healthy controls (average age = 56.2 years) fresh frozen autopsy samples were obtained from Human Brain and Spinal Fluid Research Center in Los Angeles."
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"
