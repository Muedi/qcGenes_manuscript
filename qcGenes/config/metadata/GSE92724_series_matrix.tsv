!Series_summary	"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is increasing constantly and various risk factors such as obesity, aging, nutritional states and physical inactivity, in addition to genetic pre-dispositions in different populations has been identified. The consequences of high blood glucose include damaged blood vessels, leading to arteriosclerosis and chronic diabetic microangiopathies. These changes lead to occlusive angiopathy, altered vascular permeability, or tissue hypoxia, resulting in complications such as heart disease, strokes, kidney disease, blindness, impaired wound healing, chronic skin ulcers, or amputations. We isolated dermal endothelial cells from diabetic patients (Pat) and control individuals (Ctrl) and performed RNASeq to compare differentially expressed genes."
!Series_overall_design	"Surgical samples of human skin were taken from Type 2 diabetic patients and non-diabetic patients. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and all included patients gave their informed consent (no. 449/2001; 81/2008). Endothelial cells (CD31+, CD45-, Podoplanin-) from 4 diabetic patients (Pat) and 6 controls (Ctrl) were FACS sorted and processed for RNA Seq."
