!Series_summary	"We have utilized the RNA-Seq technology to identify genes with distinct expression patterns between failing and non-failing hearts. In an era of next-generation sequencing studies, our study demonstrates how knowledge gained from a small set of samples with accurately measured gene expressions using RNA-Seq can be leveraged as a complementary strategy to discern the genetics of complex disorders."
!Series_overall_design	"Identify the signature genes based on RNA-seq come from six Heart Failure and healthy individuals. Validation is based on Affymetrix microarray of a total of 313 individuals with/without Heart Failure."
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"
