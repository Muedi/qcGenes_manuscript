!Series_summary	"RNAseq analysis of human CD4+ regulatory Tregs and Tconvs in COVID-19 and healthy donors isolated from peripheral blood."
!Series_overall_design	"Human Tregs and Tconvs from COVID-19 patients and healthy donors were magnetically isolated from frozen PBMCs using a Stem Cell kit, as CD4+CD25hiCD127lo and CD4+CD25–, respectively. Around 1,000 isolated cells were directly into lysis buffer for RNA-seq (Smart-seq2)  library preparation following the standard ImmGen low-input protocol (www.immgen.org). Samples were collected and sequenced in two cohorts."
