!Series_summary	"Tuberculosis (TB) is responsible for the majority of mortality and morbidity associated with infectious diseases worldwide. The characterization of exact molecular components of immune response associated with protection against TB may help design more effective therapeutic interventions. In this study, we aimed to characterize the immune signature of memory T cells associated with latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Transcriptomic profiling using RNA sequencing was performed on memory CD4 and CD8 T cells isolated from individuals with latent tuberculosis, as well as from tuberculosis negative healthy controls. Overall, we found specific gene signatures in each cell subset that could successfully discriminate between individuals with latent tuberculosis and healthy controls."

"The single-end reads that passed Illumina filters were filtered for reads aligning to tRNA, rRNA, adapter sequences, and spike-in controls. The reads were then aligned to UCSC hg19 reference genome using TopHat (v 1.4.1) (Trapnell et al., 2009). DUST scores were calculated with PRINSEQ Lite (v 0.20.3) (Schmieder et al., 2011) and low-complexity reads (DUST > 4) were removed from the BAM files.  The alignment results were parsed via the SAMtools (Li et al., 2009) to generate SAM files. Read counts to each genomic feature were obtained with the htseq-count program (v 0.6.0) (Anders et al., 2014) using the “union” option."
