!Series_summary	"Although recent advances in high-throughput technology have provided many insights into gastric cancer (GC), few reliable biomarkers for handling diffuse type GC are identified. Here, we aim to identify a signature classifying high risk diffuse type GC. To identify molecular subtypes of diffuse type GC, we generated RNA-seq based transcriptome data, which were generated using normal mucosa and tumor cells from 140 fresh frozen tissues including diffuse type GCs (n = 107). Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of the RNA-seq data revealed three distinct subgroups of GC. Based on these subtypes, we generated a signature reflecting the best characteristics of aggressive diffuse type GC. When estimating prognostic value, the signature showed a strong prediction ability and an independent clinical utility in diffuse type GC patients. Our signature represents a promising diagnostic tool for the identification of diffuse type GC patients that have a high risk of poor clinical behavior."
!Series_overall_design	"RNA-seq data of 140 fresh frozen tissues including diffuse type gastric cancer tissues (n = 107), intestinal type gastric cancer tissue (n = 23) and normal gastric tissues (n = 10) were generated. Total RNA was isolated by RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The quality and integrity of the RNA were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining, followed by visual examination under ultraviolet light. Sequencing library was prepared using TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation kit v2 (Illumina, CA, USA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocols. Briefly, mRNA was purified from total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads, fragmented, and converted into cDNAs. Then, adapters were ligated and the fragments were amplified on a PCR. Sequencing was performed in paired end reads (2x75 bp) using NextSeq 500 platform (Illumina)."
