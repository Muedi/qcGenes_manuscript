!Series_summary	"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including two main molecular subtypes termed activated B cell-like (ABC) and germinal center B cell-like (GCB). ABC DLBCL is less curable and identification of new molecular targets is needed for the development of effective therapeutic agents. Here, we focused on EGR1, a transcription factor that is regulated by the B cell receptor and JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway in ABC DLBCL. ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq analyses revealed that gene regulation by EGR1 in ABC DLBCL accentuates multiple oncogenic pathways, including MYC and E2F, while dampening the lethal type I IFN pathway."
!Series_overall_design	"TMD8 and OCI-LY10 cells were treated by shsc4 or shEGR1 knockdown, ChIP-seq experiments were performed by EGR1 antibody (Santa Cruz sc-110)."
!Series_overall_design	"Cells transduced with control shRNA, shEGR1#8 or shEGR1#9 in OCI-LY10, TMD8 and SUDHL2 cells were induced with 20 ng/ml doxycycline for 2 days. Total RNA from these cells was then used for RNA-seq analysis."
