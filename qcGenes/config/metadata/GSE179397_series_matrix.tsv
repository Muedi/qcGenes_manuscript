!Series_summary	"Coronary artery disease (CAD) poses a worldwide health threat. Compelling evidence shows that pericardial adipose tissue (PAT), a brown-like adipose adjacent to the external surface of the pericardium, is associated with CAD. However, the specific molecular mechanisms of PAT in CAD are elusive.  For characterizing human PAT and explore its association with CAD, the transcriptome characteristics were assessed in 5 CAD patients and 4 controls via RNA-sequencing."
!Series_overall_design	"mRNA profiles of PAT cells in CAD and control patients were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina NovaSeq 6000."
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"

Briefly, the poly-A containing mRNA molecules were purified using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. Thereafter, the mRNA was fragmented into small pieces using divalent cations under 94°C for 8 min. The cleaved RNA fragments were copied into first-strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random primers. Subsequently, the second strand cDNA was synthesized using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. These cDNA fragments then underwent an end repair process, the addition of a single ‘A’ base, and ligation of the adapters. The products were purified and enriched with PCR to generate the final cDNA library. Clean libraries were quantified using a Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, USA), and validated by Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA) to confirm the insert size and evaluate the mole concentration. Cluster was generated using cBot with the library diluted to 10 pM and then was sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina, USA)."
