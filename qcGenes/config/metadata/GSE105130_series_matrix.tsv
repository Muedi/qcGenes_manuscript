!Series_summary	"Purpose: The goal of this study is to get a comprehensive evaluation of the transcriptome profile of HCC patients"
!Series_summary	"Methods:Transcriptome profiles of paired Tumor and adjacent non-tumour from 25 HCC patients were generated by deep sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Paired sample T-test was used to identify differentially expressed genes between Tumours and adjacent non-Tumours."
!Series_summary	"Results: A total of 4462 genes are differentially expressed genes between tumours and adjacent non-tumours"
!Series_summary	"Conclusions: Characterization of the transcriptome profiles of HCC patients reveals key genes and pathways that are deregulated in HCC patients."
!Series_overall_design	"Transcriptome profiles of paired Tumor and adjacent non-tumour from 25 HCC patients were generated by deep sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform."
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"
