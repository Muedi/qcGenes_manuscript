!Series_summary	"We report the application of paired Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) and RNA-seq data to profile the regulatory landscape and expression of 5 primary Plasma Cell (PC), 28 Multiple Myeloma (MM) PC as well as 5 cell lines samples. Findings discriminated MM and MM subgroup-specific changes such as the exclusive overexpression of CCND1 and CCND2 oncogenes. DNA accessibility changes were correlated to gene expression in a topologically constrained manner to elucidate novel enhancer - promoter interactions, genes and pathways critical for myeloma biology and developmentally activated or de novo formed enhancers. Additionally, the MM subgroup-specific TF network dependencies were studied to help identify prognostic markers. Finally, we discover and functionally validate the critical enhancer that regulates ectopic expression of CCND2 in MM."
