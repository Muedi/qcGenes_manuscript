!Series_summary	"The Illumina NextSeq500 was used to sequence the gene expression profiles of 21 ileal fibroblast samples. Samples included 6 control samples and 15 Crohn’s disease samples. The Crohn’s disease samples can be further subdivided into inflamed (4), non-inflamed (6) and stenotic (5) samples."
