These biases are particularly evident in {HTS} assays for identifying regulatory regions in {DNA} ({DNase}-seq, {ChIP}-seq, {FAIRE}-seq, {ATAC}-seq). Biases may result from many experiment-specific factors, including selectivity of {DNA} restriction enzymes and fragmentation method, as well as sequencing technology-specific factors, such as choice of adapters/primers and sample amplification methods.},

	abstract = {Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing ({ChIP}-seq) is widely used to detect genome-wide interactions between a protein of interest and {DNA} in vivo. Loci showing strong enrichment over adjacent background regions are typically considered to be sites of binding. Insufficient attention has been given to systematic artifacts inherent to the {ChIP}-seq procedure that might generate a misleading picture of protein binding to certain loci. We show here that unrelated transcription factors appear to consistently bind to the gene bodies of highly transcribed genes in yeast. Strikingly, several types of negative control experiments, including a protein that is not expected to bind chromatin, also showed similar patterns of strong binding within gene bodies. These false positive signals were evident across sequencing platforms and immunoprecipitation protocols, as well as in previously published datasets from other labs. We show that these false positive signals derive from high rates of transcription, and are inherent to the {ChIP} procedure, although they are exacerbated by sequencing library construction procedures. This expression bias is strong enough that a known transcriptional repressor like Tup1 can erroneously appear to be an activator. Another type of background bias stems from the inherent nucleosomal structure of chromatin, and can potentially make it seem like certain factors bind nucleosomes even when they don't. Our analysis suggests that a mock {ChIP} sample offers a better normalization control for the expression bias, whereas the {ChIP} input is more appropriate for the nucleosomal periodicity bias. While these controls alleviate the effect of the biases to some extent, they are unable to eliminate it completely. Caution is therefore warranted regarding the interpretation of data that seemingly show the association of various transcription and chromatin factors with highly transcribed genes in yeast.},

	abstract = {The main application of {ChIP}-seq technology is the detection of genomic regions that bind to a protein of interest. A large part of functional genomics’ public catalogs is based on {ChIP}-seq data. These catalogs rely on peak calling algorithms that infer protein-binding sites by detecting genomic regions associated with more mapped reads (coverage) than expected by chance, as a result of the experimental protocol's lack of perfect specificity. We find that {GC}-content bias accounts for substantial variability in the observed coverage for {ChIP}-seq experiments and that this variability leads to false-positive peak calls. More concerning is that the {GC} effect varies across experiments, with the effect strong enough to result in a substantial number of peaks called differently when different laboratories perform experiments on the same cell line. However, accounting for {GC} content bias in {ChIP}-seq is challenging because the binding sites of interest tend to be more common in high {GC}-content regions, which confounds real biological signals with unwanted variability. To account for this challenge, we introduce a statistical approach that accounts for {GC} effects on both nonspecific noise and signal induced by the binding site. The method can be used to account for this bias in binding quantification as well to improve existing peak calling algorithms. We use this approach to show a reduction in false-positive peaks as well as improved consistency across laboratories.},
